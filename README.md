# Open3D_Point-Cloud
This project is tasked to load the point cloud data and a corresponding texture image.

Point Cloud: The point cloud file represents 3D coordinates with RGB color information for each point. This file contains the 3D structure of an object in the form of a set of data points in space. Visualizing this point cloud gives us a base from which to perform surface reconstruction.

To experiment with the point cloud, we use the famous Stanford Bunny for my assignment. I found sample point clouds in .ply or .pcd format on the website: Stanford 3D Scanning Repository, then fed the image of ‘bun_zipper_res2’ from the “bunny\reconstruction repository”.
